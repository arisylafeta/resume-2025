Phase 1:
In @Hero.tsx
1. Add a typewriter effect with the text saying: "Hi there, my name is Ari".
2. After the typewriter finishes, a subtitle should appear below with the text "I've cofounded Salespeak, a startup helping SMBs reach out to and qualify leads using Voice AI. Sounds interesting?"
3. Then an animated arrow pointing down should welcome the users to scroll below: "Learn More"

Phase 2:
In @About.tsx
1. An "Who am I?" title with some interesting animation
2. The screen should be split in two parts, in the left part(top on mobile) there will be an image of me. 
3. In the right part, there should be a vertical slider with 4 points. Each point will show a piece of text(overflown), for "summary", "education", "work experience", "Likes and Interests"

Note that the image, should stay static, while the user scrolls between the 4 mini-sections. Use lorem ipsum for the text for now.
